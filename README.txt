Welcome to my Data Science Wine page!

This is a simple project exploring the effects of weather patterns on flavors in wine. The original idea was to use it as an analog for how large scale processes (weather, world economy, federal policy etc.) can affect many small scale processes (small businesses, state-level effects etc.). It is a work in progress.
